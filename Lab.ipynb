    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lab, you will select a prediction task to perform on your dataset, evaluate two different deep learning architectures and tune hyper-parameters for each architecture. If any part of the assignment is not clear, ask the instructor to clarify.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report is worth 10% of the final grade. Please upload a report (one per team) with all code used, visualizations, and text in a rendered Jupyter notebook. Any visualizations that cannot be embedded in the notebook, please provide screenshots of the output. The results should be reproducible using your report. Please carefully describe every assumption and every step in your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Selection\n",
    "Select a dataset similarly to lab one. That is, the dataset must be table data and must have categorical features. In terms of generalization performance, it is helpful to have a large dataset for building a wide and deep network. It is also helpful to have many different categorical features to create the embeddings and cross-product embeddings. It is fine to perform binary classification, multi-class classification, or regression. You are NOT allowed to use the census (i.e., Adult) dataset that was given as an example in class.\n"
